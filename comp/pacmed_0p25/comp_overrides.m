% e.g., to only plot temperature zslices...
% plots(1).opt = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]; <-- turn off plotting of all other variables
% 
% e.g., to adjust depths to zslice 
% plots(1).zdeps = [100]; <-- only zslice at 100m
%
% e.g., change the latitudes or longitudes to slice at 
% plots(2).lats = [-10 10];  <-- plot zonal sections at -10S & 10N
% plots(3).lons = [230 250]; <-- plot meridional sections at 230 & 250
